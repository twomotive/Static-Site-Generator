# Static Site Generator

this project is a basic static site generator built as a learning exercise. it combines markdown files with an html template to generate a simple, static website. i worked on this project to better understand file handling, markdown parsing, and web development basics in python.

## what i learned
- **file system operations:** copying, deleting, and managing directories with `os` and `shutil`.
- **markdown parsing:** extracting headers and converting markdown to html.
- **template rendering:** replacing placeholders in an html file dynamically.
- **testing:** writing and running unit tests for key functions.
- **local hosting:** serving static files using python's built-in http server.

## usage
run the `main.sh` script to generate the site and serve it locally:
```bash
./main.sh

then, visit the site at:

http://localhost:8888
